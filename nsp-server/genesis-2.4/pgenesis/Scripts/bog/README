Here are the two examples described in the Book of Genesis (2nd Edition)

The first, in directory "network", illustrates creation of a network
model.  A simpler example of this appears in the online exercises available
at the PSC Web site (http://www.psc.edu/Packages/PGENESIS).

The second, in directory param, illustrates parameter search using
a genetic algorithm.  Much better examples of this are available at
the PSC Web site (URL above).
